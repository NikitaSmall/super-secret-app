Back-end junior uawebchallenge work.

## Technologies
1. Ruby as a language, Sinatra as a simple DSL for website tasks.
2. Mongo as a database, Mongoid as an adapter.
3. Rspec for tests, VSR to cache web requests during testing.

### Personal comment
This task shows perfectly typical N+1 query problem to external API
with huge side computing.
I may be wrong but I think that such kinds of clever/tricky tasks fits perfectly
when we can design our API. Anyway, the task is comlete.
